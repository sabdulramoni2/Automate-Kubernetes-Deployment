# **Automate Kubernetes Deployment**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the provisoning of EKS cluster using terraform and confguredAnsible to connect to the cluster. Then deployed Deployment and Service components on the cluster.

## **Feature**

### **EKS provisioning using Terraform**

- Install ansible on digital oceaan server.
- install terraform on digital ocean server.
- Created K8s cluster on AWS with terraform.
- Configure ansible to connect to EKS.
- Deployed Deployment and Service components on the cluster.
- Terraform destroy (IMPORTANT: delete all your components, if you donâ€™t want to get charged for a running cluster!)


### **Diagrammatic Presentation**

- install terraform on digital ocean server.
- Ran the following command to install terraform
  ```wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
     echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee                                        /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
  ```

- Configure ansible to connect to EKS.

    - Use this command to generate kubeconfig file that will be provided to ansible to connect to the cluster.
     ```
          aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-2 --name myapp-eks-cluster --kubeconfig /root/kubeconfig_myapp-eks-cluster
     ````

- Install the following dependencies on the host (which is ansible server in our case) that executes this module.
  
  ```
    python >=3.6
    kubernetes >=12.0.0
    PYYAML >=3.11
    jsonpatch
  ```

- Use the following command to check

  ```
      python3 -c "import YAML"
      python3 -c "import kubernetes"
      python3 -c "import jsonpatch"
  ```

- Steps to resolve:
1.	Ensure you are in your project directory: cd ~/my_k8s_project
2.	Activate your virtual environment:
   ```
      source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. After this command, your prompt must change. It should look something like this:
   ```
    (venv) root@ubuntu-s-2vcpu-2gb-nyc1-01:~/my_k8s_project#
   ```
    The (venv) prefix is the crucial indicator that you are now operating within the virtual environment.
   
4. In your Ansible Inventory (Recommended for a specific host/group). Add this two line
   ```
       localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_python_interpreter=/root/my_k8s_project/venv/bin/python
   ```
